Class project for Computer Graphics

Developed a software for creating animations using the Hierarchical Modeling system. User can define animations using various types of curves and keyframes. Also implemented a particle system which simulates the behaviour of particles attached by springs or rigid rods.

The different curves available are:

1. Linear
2. Cubic B-Spline
3. Bezier
4. Catmull-Rom
5. C2-Interpolating
6. Cardinal
7. De Castlejau
8. Lane Riesenfeld

Particle System features:

1. Colored particles
2. Springs (Editable stiffness and strain coefficients)
3. Rigid Rods
4. Collisions (Editable Stiffness)
5. Floor force (Editable Stiffness)

To build and run use the command 'make' followed by './animator'
